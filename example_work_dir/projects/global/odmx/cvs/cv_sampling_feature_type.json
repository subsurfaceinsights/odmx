        "definition": "A drilled or hand-augured hole drilled into land into which a casing has been inserted. Wells may be screened over varying lengths or unscreened. The USGS definition is more general than used here: \"A hole or shaft constructed in the earth intended to be used to locate, sample, or develop groundwater, oil, gas, or some other subsurface material. The diameter of a well is typically much smaller than the depth. Wells are also used to artificially recharge groundwater or to pressurize oil and gas production zones. Additional information about specific kinds of wells should be recorded under the secondary site types or the Use of Site field. Underground waste-disposal wells should be classified as waste-injection wells.\"",
